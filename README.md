# NotionSync for KOReader (Advanced Fork)

**NotionSync** is a powerful plugin for **KOReader** that automatically synchronizes your book highlights and notes directly to a **Notion database**. 

🚀 **This Fork's Special Powers**: Unlike the original, this version automatically extracts and syncs rich book metadata including **Authors, ISBN, Reading Progress (%), Language, Page Count, and Start Date**. It also features a "bulletproof" sync engine that adapts to your Notion database schema (so it won't crash if you set "Pages" as text instead of a number).

## ✨ Features

- 📚 **Rich Metadata Sync**  (New!)
  Automatically populates the following fields in your Notion database (if columns exist):
  - **Authors** (Supports `Multi-select` tags or `Text`)
  - **ISBN** (Robust extraction from book files)
  - **Progress** (Real-time reading percentage, derived from book stats or metadata)
  - **Language** (e.g., "en", "es")
  - **Pages** (Total page count)
  - **Start Reading** (Date you started the book)

- 🔄 **Smart & Robust Sync**  
  - **Dynamic Schema Detection**: The plugin checks your Notion database types before syncing.
  - **Crash-Proof**: If a column is missing or has the wrong type (e.g., "Pages" is text instead of number), the plugin adapts its payload automatically to prevent errors.
  - **Live Progress**: Calculates reading progress live from the document, falling back to disk metadata if needed.

- 📝 **Rich Formatting**  
  Highlights are formatted as "Scholar blocks" (Quote style) including page number, chapter, date, and a hidden link to the highlight anchor.

- ⚡ **One-Click Sync**  
  Integrated directly into the KOReader **Tools** menu. Supports gesture triggers.

## 🛠️ Notion Setup

For the best experience, create a Notion Database with the following columns. **All metadata columns are optional**—if you don't add them, the plugin simply skips them.

| Property Name | Verified Types | Description |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| **Name**     | Title | **Required**. Book title. |
| **Last Sync**| Date  | **Required**. Used to track updates. |
| **Authors**  | Multi-select *or* Text | Smart splitting of multiple authors (e.g. "Author A; Author B"). |
| **ISBN**     | Text  | The book's ISBN. |
| **Progress** | Number *or* Text | Reading percentage (0.0 to 1.0). Best formatted as `%` in Notion. |
| **Language** | Select *or* Text | Language code (e.g., `en`). |
| **Pages**    | Number *or* Text | Total pages in the book. |
| **Start Reading** | Date | Date the book was first opened/highlighted. |

> **Note**: Column names are **case-insensitive** (e.g., "progress", "Progress", "PROGRESS" all work).

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **"HTTP 400 Bad Request"**:
  - This usually means a mismatch between data sent and Notion's expectations.
  - **Good news**: This fork has a dedicated debug log! Check `koreader/notion_debug.log` (created in your KOReader root folder) to see the exact error message from Notion.

- **Missing Progress/Metadata?**:
  - Ensure the column names in Notion match (e.g., "Authors", "ISBN").
  - Check `notion_debug.log` to see if the plugin found the values (search for `NotionSync Payload`).
